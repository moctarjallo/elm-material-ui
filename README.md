Elm Material UI
===============

Elm-material-ui is a elm-ui based implementaton of the Material Design

It is a work in progress, the API is going to break often.

To have a preview of the currently implemented components, you can run
the following command from the root project:

```bash
elm reactor
```

You'll be then able to navigate through `src/MaterialUI/[the component of your choice]` and test its behaviour.
Other examples are also available through `src/Examples/`
